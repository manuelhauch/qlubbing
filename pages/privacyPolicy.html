            <br /><br />
            13.2 A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.
            <br /><br />
            13.3 Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
            <br /><br />
            13.4 Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
            <br /><br />
            13.5 We use both session and persistent cookies on our website.
            <br /><br />
            13.6 The names of the cookies that we use on our website, and the purposes for which they are used, are set out below:
            <br />
            (a) we use Google Analytics and Hotjar to recognise a computer when a user visits our website, track users as they navigate the website, improve the website's usability, administer the website, prevent fraud and improve the security of the website, target advertisements which may be of particular interest to specific users and validate authenticated users sessions.
            <br /><br />
            13.7 Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies; for example:
            <br />

            <br />
            (b) in Firefox (version 47), you can delete cookies by clicking "Tools", "Options" and "Privacy", then selecting "Use custom settings for history" from the drop-down menu, clicking "Show Cookies", and then clicking "Remove All Cookies"; and
            <br />
            (c) in Chrome (version 52), you can delete all cookies by accessing the "Customise and control" menu, and clicking "Settings", "Show advanced settings" and "Clear browsing data", and then selecting "Cookies and other site and plug-in data" before clicking "Clear browsing data".
