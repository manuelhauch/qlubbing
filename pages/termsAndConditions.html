                <b>Qlubbing Terms and Conditions</b>
            </h2>
            <h4>1. Acceptance of the terms and conditions</h4>
            Qlubbing, a private project by an individual ("<b>Qlubbing</b>", "<b>Us</b>" or "<b>We</b>"), 
            provides a software application (the "<b>App</b>") for viewing event information 
            (each an "Event"), but also for queueing times and crowd sizes at Events 
            and other related services. The services available through the App, as set
             out above, are jointly referred to as the "<b>Services</b>".

            <br />
            <br />
            
            THESE TERMS SET OUT THE CONDITIONS FOR YOUR ACCESS AND USE OF THE APP AND THE SERVICES, 
            INCLUDING ALL OF THEIR FEATURES (THE "<b>T&CS</b>"), AND WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU READ THESE T&CS 
            CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES. BY DOWNLOADING THE APP AND ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, 
            YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE T&CS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ACCEPT AND ABIDE BY THESE T&CS YOU SHOULD
             NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.

            <br />
            <br />
            
            If you are located in or a resident of the United States of America, these T&Cs provide that all disputes 
            between you and Us will be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT 
            TO ASSERT OR DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THIS CONTRACT (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court). 
            Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT A JUDGE OR JURY and your claims cannot be brought 
            as a class action. Please review Section 18 below for the details regarding your agreement to arbitrate any disputes 
            with Qlubbing.

            <br />
            <br />

            We reserve the right to revise and update these T&Cs at any time without prior notice. The date of the latest update 
            is shown at the end of these T&Cs. You are cautioned to review the T&Cs regularly to become aware of any changes. 
            By continuing to use the Services after any changes have been made, you are acknowledging your acceptance of such changes. 
            Should the T&Cs, however, be amended in a way which would entail substantial changes to the way We process your personal 
            data, you will have the right to request that We refrain from processing your personal data in such new manner.

            <h4>2. Description of the services</h4>
            <h5>2.1 The Services</h5>
            Through the App, you may view Event information (Event description, location, music genre, entrance fee, and more) 
            arranged and organized by venues or private persons (each an "<b>Event Organizer</b>"). You may also use the App get detailed
             information about the queueing times and how crowded the club is. This information is an estimate from Our side and does 
             not provide exact information about the Events. 

            <br />
            <br />
            
            <h5>2.2 Qlubbing as a technical intermediary</h5>
            Qlubbing is a technical platform that allows you and Event Organizers to connect and interact with each other. 
            As such, Qlubbing only acts as a technical intermediary between you and the Event Organizers and Qlubbing does not organize, 
            host, arrange or otherwise affiliate with Events itself. The Services may be used by you to find and attend Events, but you 
            acknowledge that Qlubbing has no responsibility or liability to you related to any Events provided to you by Event Organizers 
            through the use of the Services, other than as expressly set out in these T&Cs. You understand and acknowledge that the performance 
            of Event Organizers of an Event is outside the scope of these T&Cs and that when you make purchases in respect of an Event, 
            you enter into a binding agreement with the relevant Event Organizer, to which agreement Qlubbing has no part. Qlubbing has no 
            responsibilities to you in respect of Event Organizers Events and cannot be held responsible or liable in any way for such Events 
            towards you, the Event Organizer or any other third party. It is solely your responsibility to determine if an Event and/or Event 
            Organizer will meet your needs and expectations. If you have any questions or complaints regarding an Event, you should contact the
             relevant Event Organizer directly. Qlubbing will not participate in disputes between you and an Event Organizer.
        
            <h4>3. Creating and managing your account</h4>
            In order to use the Services, you must create an account. You must be at least eighteen (18) years old, or the age of legal majority 
            in your jurisdiction to create an account. If you are under the age of legal majority, you must obtain parental or guardian consent prior 
            to creating an account; provided that you must be at least 13 years old to use the Services notwithstanding any parental or guardian consent. 
            Account registration requires you to submit certain personal information, such as your name, address, mobile phone number, age, user name and 
            password. Once you have created an account, you may access and update your information, or delete your account, at any time.
        
            <br />
            <br />

            You are responsible for ensuring that no third party has access to your account and that the Services are not accessed or used by any unauthorised users. You agree to notify Us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account and you are solely responsible for activities that occur through the use of your account. You are further responsible for providing and maintaining accurate, complete and up-to-date information. Your failure to maintain accurate, complete and up-to-date information may result in your inability to use the Services or our termination of your account.  When you register, you will be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account.  If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at info@qlubbing.com.

            <br />
            <br />

            You are solely responsible for your use of the Services on your mobile device, including without limitation compliance with these and any applicable third party terms, and payment of any applicable third party fees.  Without limiting the foregoing, you are solely responsible for the payment of all applicable fees associated with any mobile network operator ("<b>Carrier</b>") service plan you use in connection with your use of the Services (such as voice, data, SMS, MMS, roaming, other applicable fees charged by the Carrier).  Accordingly, you should use care in selecting a service plan offered by your Carrier.  If your device is lost or stolen, you must notify Qlubbing immediately to suspend services.
            <br />
            <br />
            QLUBBING DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO USE THE SERVICES TO CONTACT FIRE, MEDICAL OR POLICE PERSONNEL IN A TIMELY MANNER OR AT ALL.  IF YOU EXPERIENCE AN EMERGENCY IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AND DIAL 911 OR 112.
        
            <h4>4. Cancelled events</h4>
            <h5>4.1 General</h5>
            As set out in Clause 2.2 above, We only act as a technical intermediary between you and Event Organizers. Each Event Organizer is fully responsible for its respective Events and all questions and/or claims in respect of Events should be directed to the relevant Event Organizer. 
            <br />
            <br />
            You are solely responsible for ensuring that an Event has not been cancelled. If an Event is cancelled, you should contact the Event Organizer directly regarding any claims in respect of refunds. We will in no event be liable for any damages whatsoever due to cancelled Events.

            <h5>13.2 US Residents</h5>
            If you are located in or a resident of the United States of America, these T&Cs will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of laws principles.

            <h4>14. Arbitration</h4>
            If you are located in or a resident of the United States of America, then the provisions of this Section 14 apply to your use of the Services and agreement with Qlubbing.
        
            <h5>14.1 Generally</h5>
            In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Qlubbing in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Qlubbing agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these T&Cs must be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these T&Cs, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE T&CS, YOU AND QLUBBING ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

            <h5>14.2 Exceptions</h5>
            Notwithstanding subsection 14.1, both parties agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims. 
        
            <h5>14.3 Arbitrator</h5>
            Any arbitration between you and Qlubbing will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "<b>AAA Rules</b>") of the American Arbitration Association ("<b>AAA</b>"), as modified by these T&Cs, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Qlubbing.
            <h5>14.4 Notice; Process</h5>
            A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("<b>Notice</b>"). Qlubbing’s address for Notice is: <b>ADRESS Sweden</b>. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("<b>Demand</b>"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Qlubbing may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Qlubbing must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.  In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Qlubbing will pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Qlubbing in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000, whichever is greater.
            <h5>14.5 Fees</h5>
            In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these T&Cs, Qlubbing will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in New York, New York provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.  If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Qlubbing for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitratorÕs ruling on the merits.
            <h5>14.6 No Class Actions</h5>
            YOU AND QLUBBING AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Qlubbing agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
            <h5>14.7 Modifications</h5>
            In the event that Qlubbing makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Qlubbing’s address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Qlubbing’s address for Notice, in which case your account with Qlubbing will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject will survive.
            <h5>14.8 Enforceability</h5>
            If Subsection 14.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 14 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 14 will be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 12 will govern any action arising out of or related to these T&Cs.
